In the attached Jupyter notebook, I have presented node classification 
(1) using Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Identity, Low- and High-pass filters [written in JAX]
and
(2) using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) [writtem in PyTorch Geometric]
for publically available homophilic/heterophilic datasets.
